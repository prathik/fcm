If you don't use `pipsi`, you're missing out.
Here are [installation instructions](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi#readme).

Simply run:

    $ pipsi install .


# Usage

To use it:

    $ fcm

or for first mode

    $ fcm -f

or for the hack mode

    $ fcm -h

For the purists out there - you can add your custom message as follows

    $ fcm -h -m "Hardcoding EU server address"

Support for ASCII signatures via the `-s` prompt

    $ fcm -s truck -m "A truck ascii signature" -h
